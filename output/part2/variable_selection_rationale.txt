Variable Selection Rationale Based on PCA:

1. Global_active_power:
   - Highest positive loading on PC1 (0.4689)
   - Represents overall power consumption in the household
   - Captures the largest variance in the dataset

2. Voltage:
   - Strong negative loading on PC1 (-0.329)
   - Low correlation with Global_active_power (-0.2959)
   - Represents supply conditions from the electricity network
   - Provides information complementary to power consumption

3. Sub_metering_3:
   - High loading on PC2 (0.4725)
   - Low correlation with both Global_active_power (0.4435) and Voltage (-0.2819)
   - Represents a specific category of appliance usage
   - Adds information that is not captured by the other two variables

This selection ensures our model uses variables that:
1. Capture different dimensions of the data (different principal components)
2. Have minimal redundancy (low correlation between variables)
3. Collectively explain a significant portion of the variance in the dataset
