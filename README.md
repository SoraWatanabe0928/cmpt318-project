# cmpt318-project
Large final assignment of CMPT 318

Grid-Sense HMM • Lightning-Fast Intrusion Detection for Critical Power Networks
Builds a fully unsupervised pipeline that scales raw SCADA telemetry, squeezes noise with PCA, and trains multivariate Hidden Markov Models (4–20 states) to spot cyber-attacks in under 300 ms. The project walks from feature scaling ➜ feature engineering ➜ model selection ➜ log-likelihood–based thresholding, turning four years of electricity-consumption data into a production-ready anomaly-detection engine.
